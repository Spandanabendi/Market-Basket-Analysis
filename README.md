### Abstract

This project aims to perform “Market Basket Analysis,” a technique used by large retailers on the data, which provides the information to the retailer to understand the purchase behavior of the buyer, which can help the retailer decide. We use two algorithms, FP growth, and Apriori, to figure out the association rules using pandas, PySpark and SparkSql. The data used are retail transactions occurring between December 2010 to December 2011 in France.

### Methodologies

1.	Apriori Algorithm
2.	FP Growth

### IDE

1. Google Colab
2. DataBricks

### Packages

1.	pyspark.ml Package: The main Pyspark package for all of Pyspark machine learning classes such as: Standard Scalar, Pipeline, Vector Assembler, and all classification models, FP-growth.
2.	Pandas: Panda’s package is a powerful data frames handling package in python. It helps reading and writing CSV files quite efficiently and has many helpful functions for data frames slicing, joining and transformation.

### Files included

#### Code Files

1. MBA_Aprior_Algorithm.ipynb - Apriori Algorithm implementation
2. MBA_FP_Growth.ipynb - FP_Growth Implementation
